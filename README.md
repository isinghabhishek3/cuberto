# 📌 What We Do – Implementation Overview  

## 🏗 Implemented Sections  
I focused on the **"What We Do"** section, ensuring it is visually engaging, smooth, and user-friendly. The goal was to create an interactive and modern UI that effectively showcases the services.  

## 💡 Challenges Faced & How I Solved Them  
1. **Smooth Animations Without Performance Issues**  
   - Initially, animations felt either laggy or too abrupt.  
   - I optimized them using **Framer Motion**, ensuring fluid transitions without affecting performance.  

2. **Responsive & Modern UI**  
   - The challenge was making the section fully responsive while keeping the design sleek.  
   - Using **Tailwind CSS**, I maintained a clean, flexible, and mobile-friendly layout.  

3. **Component Structure & Code Reusability**  
   - I structured the components modularly to keep the code clean and reusable, making future updates easier.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **React.js** – For a structured, reusable component-based UI.
